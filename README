CB'S WHAT TO DO? SCRIPT

WHAT IT DOES
This simple little script connects to a MySQL database and grabs info
from your myTinyTodo database.

myTinyTodo is an awesome open-source todo list, written in PHP by
Max Pozdeev. You can get it here:
http://www.mytinytodo.net/

DEPENDENCIES
* A myTinyTodo installation
* PHP (tested on 5.3)
* MySQL php module (so php can talk to mysql)

INSTALLATION
Just grab the php file and change the configuration info to your own.

HOW TO USE IT
Simply run php todo.php and the script will spit out un-completed items
from your todo list, list id 1 by default. It spits the output to stdout,
but also writes the results to a file.

Now that I think about it, running php todo.php >> somefile.txt might
work just as well, but then you wouldn't see the results in stdout.

WHY?
I wrote the script so I could get an up-to-date list of my todo items
in Conky. I run the script every minute via cron, and Conky reads the
file every minute.

NOTE
I'm a super newbie programmer, so there are probably a million things
I could have done more efficiently. Go easy!
